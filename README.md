# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Georgios Pisimisis and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data preparation, data exploration, data visualization, feature engineering, applied statistical modeling for Data Analysis, and presentation skills, etc. A majority of my projects are done using the Python programming language in Google Colab. Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Let’s get started!

## About Me & My Data Journey
As a Naval Architect and Marine Engineer, I possess a complete arsenal of skills in ship design, marine systems, engineering principles. As a Data Analyst, I can code in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, among other programming languages and frameworks. Combining my two passions, I excel in interpreting, processing, and analysing vessel performance data in order to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the operation of a ship. My academic training, analytical skills, and my experience with practical projects afford me a comprehensive understanding of the industry’s complex technical aspects allowing me to tackle any challenge and provide swift and intelligent solutions.
