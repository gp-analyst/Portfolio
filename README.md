# Data Analyst Portfolio

## Introduction
Hello!

Welcome to my Portfolio. My name is Georgios Pisimisis and I am excited to have you here!

In this repository, you will come across several folders and sub-folders that contain projects that demonstrate the following, but not limited to the following skills: data preparation, data exploration, data visualization, feature engineering, applied statistical modeling for Data Analysis, and presentation skills, etc. A majority of my projects are done using the Python programming language in Google Colab. Some of the most used packages are Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Scikit-Learn.

In the following sections of this README, I will provide a short summary of my data journey and brief descriptions of the projects in each folder. Let’s get started!

## About Me & My Data Journey
As a Naval Architect and Marine Engineer, I possess a complete arsenal of skills in ship design, marine systems, engineering principles. As a Data Analyst, I can code in Python, SQL, Power BI, and Tableau, among other programming languages and frameworks. Combining my two passions, I excel in interpreting, processing, and analysing vessel performance data in order to improve the efficiency and sustainability of the operation of a ship. My academic training, analytical skills, and my experience with practical projects afford me a comprehensive understanding of the industry’s complex technical aspects allowing me to tackle any challenge and provide swift and intelligent solutions.

My data journey began in my last year at University of California, Santa Barbara, where I received my History bachelor degree. I became mesmerized with data after learning how raw data was utilized by the United States to turn the tide of the war at the Battle of Midway in favor of the Allies. Prior to this, I have taken quantitative focused courses such as statistics, linear algebra, Python, etc. After exploring the use of data more in different industries such as marketing, healthcare and finance, I officially began my data education with Udacity with their [Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104). The most recent topic that I’ve learned is how to build a Machine Learning pipeline and make recommendation engines from their [Data Scientist Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-scientist-nanodegree--nd025).

## Projects
### Wine Origin Classification Using k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN) Algorithm
For this project, I am mainly interested in conducting data exploration and analysis on the offensive stats and characteristics of different NBA teams based on Finals ranking which is a new column I will create that contains 4 values: Champion, Runner-Up, Knocked Out and Never Qualified. This project contains a total of 3 notebooks that describe the steps that I’ve taken; the skills that I’ve focused on in this project are data gathering via web-scraping, data cleaning and data exploration(analysis and visualization).
